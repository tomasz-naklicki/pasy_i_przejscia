![banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd38583b-0cd6-4013-8cd7-eebd29a1bb40)

We reecommend making this README pleaseant to read, you can later use it as portfolio `:)`

## Dataset
- on what data trained
- how many annotations
- how the data was prepared (e.g. preprocessed)
- store the dataset with annotations in XXX and provide a link here
- what format for data and how to load it

## Training
- what network, how trained, what parameters
- what augmentation methods used
- what script to run the training
- remember to have a fully specified Python environemnt (Python version, requirements list with versions)
- other instructions to reproduce the training process

## Results
- Example images from dataset (diverse), at least 4 images
- Examples of good and bad predictions, at least 4 images
- Metrics on the test and train dataset

## Trained model in ONNX ready for `Deepness` plugin
- model uploaded to XXX and a LINK_HERE
- model have to be in the ONNX format, including metadata required by `Deepness` plugin (spatial resolution, thresholds, ...)
- name of the script used to convert the model to ONNX and add the metadata to it

## Demo instructions and video
- a short video of running the model in Deepness (no need for audio), preferably converted to GIF
- what ortophoto to load in QGIS and what physical place to zoom-in. E.g. Poznan 2022 zoomed-in at PUT campus
- showing the results of running the model

## People
- who worked on the project
